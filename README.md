# Calendar

This is a simple calendar app to help schedule the users day. It utilizes third-party APIs and jQuery to help the user save dynamically created events for each hour of the day in the browser. I utilized JQUERY to manipulate the html file with my javascript. This helps the program adjust if more hours in the day are wanted.

This is what the page looks like.

Past events are grayed out depending on the time the page is viewed. The current event is highlighted red, and future events are green.
The user can input their own events that will be saved even after the page is refreshed.

The time is pulled whenever the page is opened.

## 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
